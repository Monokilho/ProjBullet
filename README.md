# ProjBullet

Experimental game project. It consisted using a 3rd-party program to "read" a music value and use those to create a rythm bullet hell game where the player could create scripts using lua langauge. These Scripts are used to create the random patterns of the bullets.

Currently not working due to plugin's failure (LUA51.dll)
